DAYS ON MARKET AND PRICE CUTS

Days to Pending: How long it takes homes in a region to change to pending status on Zillow.com after first being shown as for sale. The reported figure indicates the number of days (mean or median) that it took for homes that went pending during the week being reported, to go pending. This differs from the old “Days on Zillow” metric in that it excludes the in-contract period before a home sells.
Days to Close (mean/median): Number of days between the listing going pending and the sale date.
Share of Listings With a Price Cut: The number of unique properties with a list price at the end of the month that’s less than the list price at the beginning of the month, divided by the number of unique properties with an active listing at some point during the month.
Price Cuts: The mean and median price cut for listings in a given region during a given time period, expressed as both dollars ($) and as a percentage (%) of list price.
Note: “Weekly” means you can see the metric’s value on a weekly cadence. The CSVs are updated monthly.

RENTALS

Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI): A smoothed measure of the typical observed market rate rent across a given region. ZORI is a repeat-rent index that is weighted to the rental housing stock to ensure representativeness across the entire market, not just those homes currently listed for-rent. The index is dollar-denominated by computing the mean of listed rents that fall into the 40th to 60th percentile range for all homes and apartments in a given region, which is weighted to reflect the rental housing stock.
